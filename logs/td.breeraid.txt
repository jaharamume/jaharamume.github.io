Spfthirty is a level ten Cave Troll Softskin.
I am the proud inventor of Paleface-block, the newest development in Troll
skin care.  I currently am looking for test subjects to test the effectiveness
of the block on Trolls.  I happily report that tests with orcs and numenoreans
were completely successful.  Not a single orc or numenorean sundied during the
six-month test period!

<p class="explanation">We have one practice session left, but don't really want 
  any of the other skills here. Don't waste this one session on something you 
  don't need; rather, keep it until your character gains a level, when you will 
  be able to practice the above skills to a greater degree, or perhaps practice 
  new skills that your character cannot use yet.</p>

<p class="explanation">Now that we've practiced some skills, let's take a break 
  and spend some money! Fornost, luckily, is very rich in useful items that can 
  be bought for relatively cheap prices. So lets take a walk down to the Traveller's 
  Shop and see what items we can buy for our aspiring adventurer. </p>

<p class="explanation"> It seems that Fuor was lucky enough to come at the right 
  time when the Traveller's Shop just opened for the day. If it were night, the 
  shop would be closed and we would have to wait for the morning again for it 
  to open up.<br>
  <br>
  But before we can start finding items and start buying them we must find out 
  how much money we have in Fuor's funds to get an idea of what we can afford. 
  Being new to Fornost, I doubt Fuor has much currency on him, so lets check by 
  using <font class="COMMAND">info</font>, or for short <font class="COMMAND">inf,</font> 
  to find out how much money he has.</p>

<p class="explanation">If we look from the second from the bottom line we can 
  see that Fuor has exactly 5 silver pennies and 46 copper pennies. Now don't 
  panic if you're seeing something different on your character, Elves use the 
  same system of currency but the coin names have been changed.<br>
  (lauren = gold, celeb = silver, busc = copper)<br>
  <br>
  Now that we know we have about 6 silver coins in currency, we can check to see 
  what items this shopkeeper has in stock by using the <font class="COMMAND">list</font> 
  command.</p>

<p class="explanation">Well now, we've now reached 35% of the shopkeeper's stock 
  listing. A page break has been planted here to allow you to view the current 
  selection of goods.</p>
<p class="explanation">By examining the list we can see some very useful items 
  already. A dark coloured flasks full of oil will be useful in the future when 
  Fuor's lantern is running low, so buying a flask wouldn't be a bad idea. Another 
  useful item here would be the water skin, which can hold much more water than 
  the small cup that was issued in the newbie kit.</p>
<p class="explanation">Now that we've found some items that we would like to buy 
  we should exit the page break by using <font class="COMMAND">q</font> for quit. 
  Items can be bought be either their names or by their number. In this case, 
  Fuor wants to purchase a dark coloured flask full of oil and a water skin by 
  using the <font class="COMMAND">buy</font> command.</p>
